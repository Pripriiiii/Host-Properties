# Host-Properties
This repository stores and updates datasets and relevant notebooks for host galaxy properties computations.

## Repository Contents

### Jupyter Notebooks

- **Host_Properties**:  
  This notebook covers essential procedures for computing host properties (LOGMASS, (U-R) colour, dDLR).


### Dataset

- **DEBASS_allHost**:
Contains RA&DEC for SN&Host; and host galaxy property measurements of DEBASS sample.

- **FN_Host_Properties**:
Contains RA&DEC for SN&Host; and host galaxy property measurements of Foundation sample.

- **In_Both**:
Contains DEBASS SNe Ia that image cut-outs are available in both PS1 and SDSS surveys.

- **Only_PS1**:
Contains DEBASS SNe Ia that image cut-outs are available only in the PS1 survey.

- **FN_PS1_ONLY**:
Contains FN SNe Ia that image cut-outs are available only in the PS1 survey.

- **FN_PS1_SDSS**:
Contains FN SNe Ia that image cut-outs are available in both PS1 and SDSS surveys.

- **Model Prediction**:
Contains extracted data of the Childress2014 Mass Distribution Model.

- **alpha_lyr_stis_005.ascii**, **sr.dat**, **sux.dat**:
Bessell filter curves in SALT2 are used for host (U-R) colour computation.
